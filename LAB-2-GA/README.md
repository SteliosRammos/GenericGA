## Getting Started

We offer a generic implementation of a Genetic Algorithm as well as two use cases, namely the Knapsack Problem and the Traveling Salesperson Problem. 


## Running the tests

Refer to `Knapsack.py` and `TSP.py` to see examples of how to build and evolve the genetic algorithm.

For examples of test Figures refer to the `figures` folder.
